An automatic password generator is a tool that creates strong, random passwords for your online accounts. These passwords are typically composed of a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, making them extremely difficult for hackers to crack.
How They Work
Password generators typically allow you to customize the password length and the types of characters included. Once you set your preferences, the generator creates a random sequence of characters that meets your criteria.
Popular Password Generators
Many websites and software applications offer built-in password generators. Additionally, there are standalone tools and password manager services that provide robust password generation capabilities.
